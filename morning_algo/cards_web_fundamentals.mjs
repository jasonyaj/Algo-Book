/* 
  Deck of Cards

  From the imported arrays, create a function that
  builds a deck of cards. The deck will be a one-
  dimensional array of objects, such that each object
  represents one card in the deck.

  Example card: { suit: 'hearts', rank: '2' };
  
  Bonus: Use the included emoji matrix array to add
  a third property to each card.

  Example card with emoji property:
  { suit: 'hearts', rank: '2', emoji: 'ðŸ‚²' };

/* 
  Shuffle
  
  Using the built deck, create a shuffle function
  implementing the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm.
  Return the deck after the shuffle.
